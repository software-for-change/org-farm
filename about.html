                <h2>LEARN OUR STROY</h2>
                <p>There's more to this beyond selling furits and vegetables</p>

            </div>


            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>01</h1>
                <h2>Creativity</h2>
                <p>our dad is a farmer and he had failed to sell his produce. at least, to what we would consider high potential
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>02</h1>
                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>we explored this problem to see if it existed else where. well, we had opened a can of worms. many people suffered becasue of lack of market. So we thought, if we jump in and attempt to solve this problem, how far along can we reach? We
                    are trying to find out now</p>

            </div>
            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>03</h1>
                <h2>Honesty</h2>
                <p>we also found more problems, price gauging. if we were selling designer fits, we were willing to contend with exuberent prices for items. Food on the other hand, a necssity, it just seemed aboherent that people were paying such prices.
                    We knew they didn't have to. So we sought to provide a solution.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>04</h1>
                <h2>Brand</h2>
                <p>our work is more than selling vegetables. we are transforming communities. we are chaning the status quo and are providing an income.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>05</h1>
                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>A team is only as strong as it's weakest link. Ironcially our strongest and weakest link is farming. this is also a root problem, if the wanainchi is not supported, as a country, we can't grow or rise our gdp. Teaching people new skills
                    is hard inisteslf. but how about we use what they already have? they can farm. if we can get an income for them through what they already know, that's a start in dramatically decreasing the rate of povery in our country.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>06</h1>
                <h2>Cause</h2>
                <p>
                    we can't teach people how to read and code if they lack food. finding market for their produce, is giving them access to resources. decreasing poverty and lifiting up the wanainchi.
