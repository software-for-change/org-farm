    <h1> free produce</h1>

    <p>We know that our customers love our service and they are our best spokespeople! That's why we give you a $10 credit on your account for every person you refer to us. It's our little way of saying thanks for talking about us, and a great way for you to get free organic fruits and veggies!

When you tell a friend about us, all they have to do is put your name down when they sign up so we know who to thank. Then, when they receive their second order, we'll add a $10 credit to your account. It's simple, and you don't have to do anything (except tell your friends about us!) We take care of the rest, and your credits will automatically be applied towards your next box of produce.


No Limit, just lots of free fruits & veggies 
The best part is, there is no limit to how much credit you can earn. The credit never expires, and there is no limit! If you refer three people to us, then you just earned enough to get a free small box of produce- and have enough left over to add extra strawberries and blueberries! The credit never expires, and there is no limit! 

If you'd like some flyers, just let us know and we'd be more than happy to include some with your next delivery.
