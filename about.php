                <h2>HOW IT ALL STARTED</h2>
                <p>The birth of raining vegetables...</p>
            </div>


            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>01</h1>
                <h2>The Begining</h2>
                <p> My parents are farmers who have had success growing food but never made alot of profit selling it. My dad, like many farmers, planted his crops based on the speculation that there was an anxious market awaiting his produce. He would say
                    to me, "Mercy, just wait and see, the market is hot. I'm going to sell everything". He didn't. When it came to harvesting and selling, either he would have no market at all or they would only offer to buy it for peanuts to the shilling.
                    What happened to the inital promise of an anxious market?
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>02</h1>
                <h2>Discovery</h2>
                <p> Was my father the only farmer who had failed to sell his produce? After some research, I discovered he was not. Despite the fact that over 90% of Ugandans are farmers, only 20% are able to find market for their produce. Of the 20%, those
                    who supply to main markets reap the highest benefits due to the high buying prices in these markets. This is the anxious market many small scale farmers hope they can sell to. Unfortunately, small scale farmers who don't make it to
                    the 20% lose their food to spoilage. Worse still, the customer still bears the burden of buying overpriced food in main markets. Why are Ugandans buying overpriced food yet small scale farmers have quality produce going to waste?</p>

            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>03</h1>
                <h2>Birth of a Cause</h2>
                <p>we also found more problems, price gauging. if we were selling designer fits, we were willing to contend with exuberent prices for items. Food on the other hand, a necssity, it just seemed aboherent that people were paying such prices.
                    We knew they didn't have to. So we sought to provide a solution.</p>

                <h1>04</h1>
                <h2>Brand</h2>
                <p>our work is more than selling vegetables. we are transforming communities. we are chaning the status quo and are providing an income.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>05</h1>
                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>A team is only as strong as it's weakest link. Ironcially our strongest and weakest link is farming. this is also a root problem, if the wanainchi is not supported, as a country, we can't grow or rise our gdp. Teaching people new skills
                    is hard inisteslf. but how about we use what they already have? they can farm. if we can get an income for them through what they already know, that's a start in dramatically decreasing the rate of povery in our country.</p>

            <div class="w3-third story-col">
                <h1>06</h1>
                <h2>Cause</h2>
                <p>
                    we can't teach people how to read and code if they lack food. finding market for their produce, is giving them access to resources. decreasing poverty and lifiting up the wanainchi.
